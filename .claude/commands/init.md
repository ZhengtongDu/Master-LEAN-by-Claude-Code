# Init Project

When initializing or updating CLAUDE.md for this project, ensure it includes the following task tracking sections at the end of the file:

```markdown
## Current Task

[Describe the current task here]

## Task Queue

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] ...

## Completed

- [x] YYYY-MM-DD: Completed task description
```

After adding these sections:
1. Analyze the project to populate appropriate initial tasks
2. Set the first task as the Current Task
3. Commit the changes to git
