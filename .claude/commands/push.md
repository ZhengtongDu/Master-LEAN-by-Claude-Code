# Push Command

Automatically stage all changes in the current directory, generate an appropriate commit message, and push to the remote repository.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` to check all untracked and modified files
2. Run `git diff` to see the specific changes
3. Analyze the changes and generate a concise, accurate commit message in English
4. Use `git add` to stage all relevant files (excluding .html temporary files)
5. Use `git commit` to commit the changes
6. Use `git push` to push to the remote repository

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use English
- First line should be a short summary (under 50 characters)
- If necessary, add a blank line followed by detailed description
- Add Co-Authored-By signature at the end

## Notes

- Do not commit .html temporary files
- Do not commit files containing sensitive information (e.g., .env)
- If there are no changes, inform the user that no commit is needed
